// The contract between the engine and a blockchain.
//
// The ENGINE is everything that draws blocks, towers and the camera, keeps the list of blocks, the feed and the scene
// in sync: core/, scene/, state/, ui/, controllers/ and app.js. It knows nothing about any blockchain.
// A CHAIN is one object, registered with Explorer.defineChain(spec) before the engine's own scripts run: it gives the engine
// its numbers (how big is a block, which fee rates are cheap or expensive), its words (what a block card says) and,
// later in this contract, where its data comes from. The engine only ever reads them from Explorer.chain.
// Everything that is specific to one chain lives in its own folder: js/chains/<name>/ (Bitcoin: js/chains/bitcoin/).
//
// The block model the engine reads (whatever the chain): { id, height, previousblockhash, timestamp }; any other field
// of a block is only read by the chain's own functions below (cards, lines, fill...).
// The tower model the engine draws (whatever the chain): { txid, vsize, rate, coinbase?, approx? }
//   vsize: size in "capacity units" (virtual bytes for Bitcoin, gas for Ethereum...); the name is historical
//   rate:  price per unit of size (sat/vB for Bitcoin, gwei per gas...); it gives the tower its color and height. It need not be
//          a price per unit: Solana uses the priority fee the transaction paid, whatever its size
//   coinbase: the block reward transaction (drawn gold, in the corner), approx: size unknown (provisional data)
