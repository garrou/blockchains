// The XRP Ledger, as the engine sees it (see the contract in js/core/chain.js): its numbers, its words, its data, its screens.
//
// How the XRP Ledger maps to the engine's ideas:
//   block        a ledger. One closes every 3 to 5 seconds and, once validated, is final: no forks, so every ledger is shown
//   tower        a transaction. Its COLOR says what it is (a payment, an order of the exchange, a trust line, an AMM pool, an
//                NFT...; red when it failed), its footprint how many ledger objects it touched (the AffectedNodes of its metadata),
//                its height how far its fee is above the reference fee. The fee is 10 drops for nearly everybody, so towers are
//                flat; a spike is someone who paid more. See core/txs.js
//   full block   there is no limit to a ledger's size, only a number of transactions the servers expect before the fee rises
//                (about 2,000). capacity.size is a scale tuned to ordinary ledgers (about 100 transactions of 6 objects each)
//   next block   none: no mempool can be read, so there is no "next" slot and no pending transaction
// The page talks to the servers over ONE WebSocket (data/ws.js), which carries the commands as well as the ledgers that close.
//
// Loaded before the engine files that read Explorer.chain at load time (core/colors.js).
